Had the chance to make a quick day trip to San Jose and visit CGA! Definitely a chill park overall, nothing too crazy, though all the rides were fairly bumpy for some reason lol.

1. RailBlazer - RMC's prototype single rail...a little rough around the edges!
2. Flight Deck - My first greyout??
3. Drop Tower - Felt taller than I expected!
4. Patriot - Somewhat smooth yay
5. Gold Striker - Bumpy and noisy like any wooden coaster :/
6. The Grizzly - Super old station
7. The Demon - Apparently historical
8. Pyscho Mouse - Psycho line
9. Mass Effect: New Earth - Interesting smells...
