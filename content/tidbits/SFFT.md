Was in Austin and decided to make the hour drive to San Antonio to visit one of Six Flags' flagship parks on a day with only ~9% of full capacity!

1. Iron Rattler - Two massive drops over a quarry wall make it my new favorite RMC.
2. Wonder Woman - As with SFFM, back seat only, trust!
3. Dr. Diabolical's Cliffhanger - 95 degree drop!?!
4. Joker: Carnival of Chaos - Not as crazy as CraZanity :(
5. Superman: Krypton Coaster - Nice scenery
6. Scream! - Not tall enough...
7. Road Runner Express - Ouch!
8. Goliath
9. Poltergeist - Dizzyyyy
10. Boomerang - First ride of the day!
11. Pandemonium
