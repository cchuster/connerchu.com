It was around sophomore year of high school when I first learned about the odd fact that cow farts play a considerable role in the release of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, into our atmosphere. This surprising fact led me down a rabbit hole to understand the causes and effects of climate change. Around the same time, I learned and grew skeptical of a relatively new technology, electromagnetic field therapy, which claimed to boost cell proliferation and nutrient circulation in living systems. After thorough research into the technology, I grew inspired to leverage it to address the age old problem of climate change. Several months and countless cold emails later, I was granted bench space and mentorship at the C1-biocatalysis lab at San Diego State University under Dr. Kalyuzhnaya and Richard Hamilton.
