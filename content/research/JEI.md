It was around sophomore year of high school when I first learned about the odd fact that cow farts play a considerable role in the release of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, into our atmosphere. This surprising fact led me down a rabbit hole to understand the causes and effects of climate change. Around the same time, I learned and grew skeptical of a relatiely new technology, electromagnetic field therapy, which claimed to boost cell proliferation and nutrient circulation in living systems. After reading dozes of related manuscripts, I wanted to design my own experiment to leverage this novel science by using it to address the age old problem of slowing climate change. Several months and countless cold emails later, I was granted bench space and mentorship at the C1-biocatalysis lab at SDSU under Dr. Kalyuzhnaya and Richard Hamilton.
