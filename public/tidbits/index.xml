      <description>Had the chance to make a quick day trip to San Jose and visit CGA! Definitely a chill park overall, nothing too crazy, though all the rides were fairly bumpy for some reason lol.&#xA;RailBlazer - RMC&amp;rsquo;s prototype single rail&amp;hellip;a little rough around the edges! Flight Deck - My first greyout?? Drop Tower - Felt taller than I expected! Patriot - Somewhat smooth yay Gold Striker - Bumpy and noisy like any wooden coaster :/ The Grizzly - Super old station The Demon - Apparently historical Pyscho Mouse - Psycho line Mass Effect: New Earth - Interesting smells&amp;hellip; </description>

      <title>Singular Value Decomposition</title>

      <description>Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is probably one of the coolest concepts in mathematics I have learned so far. Seen by many as the grand finale of an introductory linear algebra course, SVD combines many pervasive topics seen throughout physics and applied math, including eigenvalues/eigenvectors and unitary matrices. Although SVD was not covered in my introductory mathematical physics course, I tried my best to develop a basic understanding of this factorization tool so that I could comfortably use it when decomposing transient absorption data in my work at the Leone Group.</description>

      <description>Was in Austin and decided to make the hour drive to San Antonio to visit one of Six Flags&amp;rsquo; flagship parks on a day with only ~9% of full capacity!&#xA;Iron Rattler - Two massive drops over a quarry wall make it my new favorite RMC. Wonder Woman - As with SFFM, back seat only, trust! Dr. Diabolical&amp;rsquo;s Cliffhanger - 95 degree drop!?! Joker: Carnival of Chaos - Not as crazy as CraZanity :( Superman: Krypton Coaster - Nice scenery Scream!</description>

      <description>After going to Six Flags Magic Mountain for the second time today, I wanted to make a quick ranking of all the rides I have ridden there (coasters and flats)!&#xA;Twisted Colossus - RMC, enough said! X2 - Pure chaos. Wonder Woman - Back seat only, trust me! Tatsu - A secret line and a pretzel&amp;hellip; Drop of Doom - Are we still falling??? CraZanity - I think I&amp;rsquo;m upside down Viper - 5.</description>

      <description>I do not ride on planes often, but when I do I always think of the same two questions.&#xA;Why do I always have to turn the volume of my earbuds higher when I am on an airplane? Is it because of the lower pressure of the cabin compared to the near sea-level altitude that I am used to? Or is it simply because the loud engines drown out the noise of my music?</description>
